        <dt>What is this project?</dt>
        <dd>Web Bio Tools is an experimental collection of browser-based
            bioinformatics utilities written in Rust and compiled to
            WebAssembly. Right now, it supports pairwise sequence alignment.

        </dd>

        <dt>Where are the example sequences from?</dt>
        <dd>All of them are examples of alignments to the <a
                href="https://card.mcmaster.ca/">Comprehensive Antibiotic
                Resistance Database</a> (CARD, a database of antibiotic
            resistance genes).

            The very similar sequence is from our dog gut microbiome catalog
            (which is not fully public yet).

            The very dissimilar sequence is referenced in the <a
            href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaf173">argNorm</a>
            paper as the two ErmA genes, which were reported at the same time
            in 1985 but are not closely related.</dd>

        <dt>When I save a result do I have to log back in to see it?</dt>
        <dd>No, there is no logging in, everything is running on your browser.
            Saved results are local to you (they are saved in your browser). If
            you share them, all the information is present in the the
            URLs.</dd>
